          <p>
            New York City’s zoning laws control what can and can’t be built in
            different neighborhoods, like residential uses (housing),
            commercial uses (stores and other businesses), or manufacturing
            uses (factories). Rezoning changes the rules developers have to
            follow. If rezoning allows for more developments, it can bring
            higher rents and more money to developers. Usually, rezoning allows
            for “upzoning” of large areas, which raises land values—and rents.
